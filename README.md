### Application Programmig Interface(API)
An application programming interface, or API, enables companies to open up their applications’ data and functionality to external third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies. This allows services and products to communicate with each other and leverage each other’s data and functionality through a documented interface. Developers don't need to know how an API is implemented; they simply use the interface to communicate with other products and services. API use has surged over the past decade, to the degree that many of the most popular web applications today would not be possible without APIs.

### How API works?
An API is a set of defined rules that explain how computers or applications communicate with one another. APIs sit between an application and the web server, acting as an intermediary layer that processes data transfer between systems.

<b> Here’s how an API works:</b>
<ui>
A client application initiates an API call to retrieve information—also known as a request. This request is processed from an application to the web server via the API’s Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and includes a request verb, headers, and sometimes, a request body.
After receiving a valid request, the API makes a call to the external program or web server.
The server sends a response to the API with the requested information.
The API transfers the data to the initial requesting application.
</ui>
While the data transfer will differ depending on the web service being used, this process of requests and response all happens through an API. Whereas a user interface is designed for use by humans, APIs are designed for use by a computer or application.

#### About this API
Search APIs are software components that allow developers to seamlessly introduce search capabilities to websites and applications. They provide backend tools for indexing documents, querying various types of data, managing cluster configurations, viewing search analytics, and more.
This API is designed to search for user details in the database.

** Basically you can do some changes according to your needs like:
You can change the database.
You can change the table name.
And you can change the perimeter you want to search or display.
